Section 1: General

Q.1.1 What's IGCview?

IGCview is a program written by Ian Forster-Lewis with considerable input from
Ruud Holswilder, to display and analyze GPS log files in the IGC (International
Gliding Commission) or Gardown formats.  Both formats contain simple
ascii records of timestamped latitude/longitude data, with the IGC format
also containing altitude (pressure and/or GPS) and the task (route).
The program is wholly oriented towards looking at the GPS log traces produced
by gliders, so you can look at other traces, but the analysis will not be
particularly useful.

The software has been written as an initiative to give glider pilots some
pretty reasonable analysis software *for free*, for the general benefit of
the gliding community.  If you think the software sucks, or the 'help' is
crap, or the design flawed, then put a message on the web server set up
by Ruud to get the project moving:
   "http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Hangar/1850/igcview/"
and help us improve it.  Best of all, learn to program in Java and we'll
send you the source, and you can code some improvements, which can be
incorporated into the next release (if this happens it will be a miracle.)

The program gives three major views of the data:
* an overhead view, i.e. a 2D plot of your track which could potentially
  be overlaid on a graph.
* the graph of height with time - this is the barograph trace familiar to
  glider pilots
* the graph of height with distance travelled around an assigned task (i.e.
  route).  This is a graph similar to the braograph trace, but actually
  represents a 2D projection of the trace onto a sequence of planes lying
  vertically between each waypoint (turnpoint in glider-speak).

Q.1.2 Where's the documentation?

Check out "http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Hangar/1850/igcview/"
for and outstanding piece of work by Ruud Holswilder.

Q.1.3 What does IGCview require to run?

IGCview will run on any machine with support for Java 1.1.  In particular
this means Windows 95 and Windows NT, and most Unix workstations.  I
think there's Java support for the PowerMac also.

At the moment you have to install the Java support from somewhere, and it's
included in the IGCview zip file on 
"http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/Hangar/1850/igcview/"
but at some point we'll just use the Java support that included in
Microsoft Internet Explorer Version 4, and Netscape Version 4.

Q.1.4 What's IGCview written in?

IGCview is written in Java (version 1.1.5), which means 
(a) the program is portable and will run on any Java-supporting machine,
    today including Windows 95, Windows NT, most Unix's.
(b) The program can be placed as an applet on a web page, so people
    can access the program across the world-wide-web.  This is for the
    *next* version, however.  Then you'll be able to see maggot-races of
    glider races, instead of just the text results.


==============================================================================
Section 2: How to analyse your favorite logs

Q.2.1 How do I load an IGC file

Use the menu option "Track" then the submenu "Load".  IGCview will
prompt you with a File Load dialog set to the previously used directory,
or the initial directory set in the Configuration (see Section 4).

IGCview will pick up the date, glider-id, task, and timestamped lat/long/
altitude records from the file, and store them internally for display and
analysis.

If IGCview can't pick up a date from the IGC file, it will use today's date.
If it doesn't get a valid task from the IGC file, you have to set one up
using the Task menu option (see Q.2.4).
The glider-id is taken from the IGC file glider-id or competition-id
records, whichever occurs last.  If neither record appears in the IGC
file, then IGCview uses the filename (preceding the .igc) as the
glider-id.

IGCview doesn't care what the file is called, but it makes sense to use
a suffix ".igc" to make the files easy to recognize.  I recommend naming
the files with your glider id, as in B21.igc, to make them easy to
sort out if you have many files from the same competition day.

Q.2.2 How do I load a Gardown file

Use exactly the same procedure as for the IGC file (see Q.2.1).  IGCview
will recognize the different tracklog records within the file (they
have a different format in gardown files from IGC files).

As gardown files don't contain the funky header records that appear in
IGC files, IGCview gets the date from the *first* valid tracklog record,
uses the filename prefix (before the '.') as the glider-id, and will
*not* find a task within the file.  Thus when you create the gardown tracklog
file, it makes sense to name the file <glider-id>.gdn, or something
similar (where <glider-id> is your glider registration, e.g. B21.gdn).

Q.2.3 I've loaded a log, but the main screen is blank - what do I do?

See Q.5.2

Q.2.4 How do I define a task (i.e. a route)

Use the menu option on the main screen: "Task" "Define Task".
If the turnpoint (i.e. waypoint) database has not been loaded before, it
will be loaded now.  The turnpoint file must be in 'gardown' format, and
many are available at John Leibacher's site:
    "http://acro.harvard.edu/SSA/JL/TP/HomePage.html"

The IGCview distribution includes "bga.gdn" which is the turnpoint
database for Great Britain.  This file is the *default* turnpoint
database.  If you want to use a different turnpoint file, put the
name in the configuration (see Section 5) *before* you open the
"Define Task" window.  Then when you do open the "Define Task" window,
the correct file will be opened.

Maybe we'll include the TP file for the Netherlands as well, as Ruud
has sorted a good one out and we've used it a lot in testing.

After you've defined a task, *all* the turnpoints defined in the 
turnpoint file will appear on the map screen.  I delay the loading of
the turnpoint database to give good performance in the (forthcoming)
internet version of the program.

If your IGC file contains good task records (they're defined in the
IGC spec as beginning with 'C'), then IGCview will pick up the
task from the IGC file.  This is usually the most convenient way of
getting the task onto the screen.

If your IGC file does *not* contain the task, it may be worth
loading the IGC file, defining a task using IGCview and then saving 
an IGCfile (which will now automatically include the current task).
The new IGC file contains all the lat/long records from the original 
IGC file, but also has brand new task records so you no longer have 
to manually enter the task each time you look at the log.

Q.2.5 Why can't I see the bit of the flight before/after the start?

The configuration option 'trim logs' is by default set to 'true'.  When
the log is drawn on the map view, the sections before the start and after
the finish are not drawn, to lessen clutter on the map.

If you want to see the pre-start wandering about, change the
'trim logs' configuration option (see Section 4).

Q.2.6 How do I get the barograph trace?

Use the menu option "Window" "Altitude".  You may have to adjust the
size of the window and mess with the scroll bars to see the full trace.

The options "X-axis" "Expand" and "Compress" allow you to alter the
timescale along the x-axis.  Generally you'll have to move the 
horizontal scroll bar after an 'expand' to get back to the section you're
interested in.  It might help if you set a 'cursor' on the point of
interest (see Q.2.14).

Q.2.7 How do I get that funky height-with-distance graph?

Use the menu option "Window" "Altitude", and then change the x-axis
from displaying time to displaying distance with "X-Axis" "Distance".

The distance measurement used is the 'task distance', which is the
cumulative distance around the task to the next turnpoint, minus the 
distance the glider is from that turnpoint.  A way of visualizing the
trace is as if the flight were projected against a big vertical piece of
paper suspended between each turnpoint, and your looking at it from the
side.

As with the baro trace in Q.2.6, you can expand/compress the x-axis.

Q.2.8 How does IGCview detect thermals?

IGCview does not use altitude *at all* to detect thermalling, and defines
a 'thermal' as any point at which your cross country speed over the
next 30 seconds falls below 40 knots.  This technique has a couple of
advantages over using height climb/fall thresholds:
* Those crappy one-circle turns you took in the hope of a climb are
  still picked up as a thermal, and included in your averages  - this
  means that IGCview will often give you a lower thermalling average than
  other packages.
* IGCview can provide some thermalling statistics from Gardown logfiles,
  such as number of climbs taken, and percent of time spent circling.

The downside is that IGCview doesn't provide useful automatic analysis of
thermals in an IGC file that *only* contains height data, whereas the
EQ analysis software has the heritage of originally being baro analysis
software.  You can still use the cursors to inspect any climb on the
baro trace to get the average though (see Q.2.14).

Q.2.9 How can I replay one or more logs in a maggot race?

Load up multiple logs with "Track" "Load Track".  Look at the
"Track" "Select Tracks" panel to confirm you've loaded what you
expected (then close this panel).  Then start the race with "Replay"
"Real Time", and the glider icons will move around the course for your
viewing pleasure.  You can speed up the race with up-arrow, slow it down with
down-arrow, and race forwards or backwards with the right- and left-arrows.
Pause the race with the 'pause' key.  If the race seems slow to get started,
hit the up-arrow a few times to speed it up, then 'pause', then slow it down
again, and then hit right-arrow to continue the race.

The trouble with racing 'Real Time" is that one or more logs may have
a lot of data before the start, and you have to wait awhile before the
race gets going proper.

If you have a task defined, you can make the race more convenient by
using "Replay" "Synchro Start".  IGCview will adjust all the flights by
the right amount to have them pass through the startgate simultaneously,
so that the maggot race has more meaning, *and* as the animation starts
at 20mins or so before the synchonized start, you are insulated against
some logger's mass of logger records saved while sitting on the ground.

I guess the most important part of the 'Synchro Start' maggot race though is
that it gives you a more meaningful comparison of the competitors relative
performance, paritcularly when the starts were only a few minutes apart.
However, you still want to look at the 'Real Time' maggot race if you want to
see how much pilot gaggle-fly in modern competition, and who was leaching off
who...

Q.2.10 How do I zoom in to a particular bit of the trace?

This is easy... click the mouse on the top left corner of the area you
want to zoom into, and drag the mouse down to the bottom right corner.
You'll see a white rectangle appear (called a 'zoom box').  When you
release the mouse button, the area you surrounded with the zoom box
will fill the screen.  You can very quickly examine your flight around
turnpoints, for example.  As far as I can tell, this 'zoom box' idea is
by far the most convenient way of moving around the map.  You start with
the map "zoomed to task", and then you zoom in on each turnpoint with a
"zoom box" and zoom back out to see somewhere else.

Q.2.11 How do I zoom back out again?

Use the menu option "Zoom" "Zoom Out". IGCview keeps a history of your
"zoom in's" and "zoom out's", such that "Zoom Out" will take you back to
the screen you just left before the previous "Zoom In".

Alternatively you can "Zoom to task" if you have a task defined, which will
put the task area on the map screen, or you can "Zoom Reset" which will
take you back to the scale and coordinates defined in your configuration
file (Section 4).

Q.2.12 I've got multiple logs loaded - how do I get the "Flight Data"
       analysis for one of them?

Use the menu option "Track" "Select Tracks" and set your desired track as
the *primary*.  The "Flight Data" window is primarily an analysis of the
primary, compared against a composite of the secondary logs.  If the
multiple logs loaded are all yours, from different flights, then I presume
you would have *none* of the flights selected as secondary, and would
pick one flight at a time to be the primary.

If you've loaded a load of competition logs from the same competition day,
then you would probably pick your own flight as the primary, with
everyone else as the secondary.  Then you could maggot race the whole
day's racing.  "Flight Data" will then compare your performance with
everyone elses, and the "Climb Profile" graph will give an average
curve for all the competitors.

For more detailed analysis after a competition, you might leave your
own flight as the primary and only select the day winner as the secondary,
or perhaps the top five day placers, or maybe just the bastard you're trying
to beat.

Q.2.13 How/why do I *save* an IGC file?

How: Use the menu option "File" "Save primary log as IGC file".  You'll be
prompted for a directory/filename.

Why: It's a good way to convert a gardown file into an IGC file (load the
     gardown file, define the task, save the IGC file).
     It also enables you to embed the task into the IGC file, if it wasn't
     in there before, which is convenient for subsequent loads.

Q.2.14 How do I use the cursors?

'Click' the mouse anywhere on the main map screen, and IGCview will set
the cursor to the *nearest* log point and open a 'cursor data' window.
The units used in the 'cursor data' window are specified in the
configuration (Section 4).

There are *two* cursors, let's call them cursor1 and cursor2...
cursor1 is set when you click the mouse near a log point.
cursor2 initially is set to one logpoint further along the trace from
cursor1, and can be moved along the trace with the left- and right-arrow
keys.  The 'Home' key moves cursor1 to the start of the trace, 'End'
moves cursor2 to the end of the trace, and 'Insert' moves cursor1 to
wherever cursro2 is (get it?).

The 'cursor data' window has two halves:
The top half shows the data at and between the two cursor points, so
you can measure speeds between two points or pick up spot altitudes.
The bottom half give the data pertinent to the *section* of the
flight you are in, where a section is the current climb or cruise.
Thus if you want the climb average for a thermal, just click the
mouse somewhere on the thermal, and the bottom half of the 'cursor data'
window will tell you most of what you want to know.  Similarly click on
an inter-thermal cruise section to see the cruise speed, length, L/D,
etc of that particular cruise.  In particular I like clicking on
final glides to see how long they were in time and distance.

Q.2.15 What's the difference between the primary and secondary traces?

None really, except that IGCview gets the task from the primary log,
and the various analysis windows have the primary log highlighted in
blue (by default).  The distinction is important for the "Flight Data"
and "Climb Profile" windows, as the primary is compared with the
secondaries.  The cursors (see Q.2.14) only apply to the primary log.

Q.2.16 How do I find the lat/long of a point on the trace or map?

Use the ruler, Q.3.7

==============================================================================
Section 3: How to use IGCview to assist in scoring a gliding competition

Q.3.1 How are start times calculated?

IGCview scans forwards through the log until it find a logpoint in the
turnpoint sector for the first TP (after the start).  It then scans
*backwards* to pick up the last log point still in the start sector, and
uses that as the start point.

If you land out without rounding the first turnpoint, IGCview scans
*backwards* from the point in the trace furthest from the startpoint
to find the last log point still in the start sector (not that it really 
matters if you've landed out).

Q.3.2 How are finish times calculated?

IGCview scans forwards along the trace, detecting the rounding of each
turnpoint in turn.  Assuming you've rounded all the TP's successfully,
IGCview uses the first logpoint found in the finish sector as the finish time.

IGCview does *not* interpolate between logpoints to provide a more accurate
finish time.  This hasn't proved much of an issue with most current loggers.

Q.3.3 How are turnpoints verified as being correctly rounded

If 'beercan' sectors are used (see Section 4):
  IGCview scans along the trace measuring the distance of each log point from
  the next TP.  When that distance falls with the required radius of the
  'beercan', a successful rounding is recorded and IGCview flips onto searching
  for a successful rounding of the next TP.

If 'photo sectors' are used:
  IGCview scans along the trace as with the beercan technique, but measures
  the *track* to the next TP as well as the distance.  When both these things
  fall within the parameter of the TP sector (default 3km, 45 degrees
  either side of the bisector), IGCview records a valid turn.

The first point found in sector is highlighted (by default) with a little
yellow square.

Q.3.4 How is landing-out detected?

IGCview does *not* use altitude to detect an outlanding, but checks that the
cross-country speed has been consistently below 4 knots (averaged over 30
seconds) for a period of 2 minutes, or if there's a break in the trace for
more than 4 minutes.  These parameters seem to work ok, but I might adjust
them if it seems necessary.  The landout point recognized by IGCview is
highlighted (by default) with a little yellow square.

Q.3.5 What is the total task distance calculation?

The IGC standard calculation - distance around the task to the next TP, minus
your distance from that TP.   There is a small correction applied if you
turn a TP but then land somewhere futher from the next TP than
that TP (get it?):  the last TP rounded places a 'floor' on the distance
achieved, such that the calculated distance will not be reduced if you turn 
a TP and then land while travelling *away* from the next turnpoint.

Q.3.6 What is the task speed calculation?

('finish time' - 'start time') divided by 'total task distance'

Note that start time and finish time are from log points as in Q.3.1 and Q.3.2.

Q.3.7 How do I use the ruler?

On the map menu, use menuoption "Tools" "Ruler/Zoom".  When selected, the
'zoom box' is no longer available, and IGCview draws a line (ruler) instead
of a rectangle as you drag the mouse.

A 'ruler data' window opens which gives the lat/long of the point under the
mouse as it is dragged, and the track and length of the line are displayed.

In competition scoring you can use the ruler to confirm the lat/long of a 
landout position, and to measure the distance between that landout position
and the finish (or next TP).

Q.3.8 What about gliders that screw up their turnpoints?

IGCview will analyze that flight as a *landout*.  If on looking at the TP
you decide that's a bit harsh, and just want to give the pilot a penalty,
then relax the constraints for the TP sector (e.g. if it's photo sector, then
change to 'beercan 3km'), and IGCview will then (if you've been lax enough)
accept the flight as a completion.  Note that to get IGCview to use new
parameters for the TP sector definition you must:
  1) Modify the configuration in "File" "Startup Configuration", see
     Section 4, to use more lenient sectors.
  2) Select "File" "Use these settings" from within the config panel so
     that IGCview has these settings now as defaults (for this run).
  3) On the main window go "Task" "Define Task" "OK" to 'pretend' to
     define a new task so that IGCview recalculates the turnpoint times
     for every selected (primary and secondary) log.  If you miss this
     step  IGCview will draw pretty circles on the map representing the
     new beercan sectors (if that's what you've chosen) but the primary
     task will still have the turnpoint times form the earlier assessment
     done when the log was loaded or the task first defined.

To assess a given TP for penalties, zoom in to the pertinent TP, and use
the 'ruler' to measure the pilots error.  You can measure the distance from
the sector by measuring  from the nearest log point to the sector, and you can
calculate the angle error by starting the ruler on the TP, dragging the
ruler along the the nearest sector boundary to see the track of that boundary,
and then moving the ruler around to the 'best' log point to see the track
from the TP to that log point.  The difference of these two track angles gives
you the angle error outside the sector.

Section 4: Configuration options

To modify the configuration of IGCview, use "File" "Startup Configuration"
on the main window menu.

There are quite a few options, and hopefully most are self-explanatory.

After you've modified the configuration, you must select "File"
"Use these setting" to get IGCview to accept the changes.  As mentioned 
above in Q.3.8, you may have to re-define the task, or re-load a log, to
have some changes take effect.

If you want the changes to become the defaults for each run of the
program, you should:
  1) use "File" "Startup Configuration" to bring up the config panel
  2) make the changes
  3) select "File" "Use these settings" on the config panel to get
     IGCview to accept the changes
  4) re-open the config panel with "File" "Startup Configuration" on the
     main window again
  5) select "File" "Save Configuration" on the config panel menu and
     save the configuration in a file called "IGCview.cfg".

IGCview reads the file "IGCview.cfg" on startup and uses the parameters
found within it.  If you think you've screwed this file up, just delete it -
IGCview will start ok using defaults, and you can save a new one.

'Box around thermals' : When IGCview detects thermalling flight, it
  scans along it and records the boundaries (max/min lat/long) of the
  circling flight.  If you select this option, IGCview will draw a box
  around each 'thermal' it's detected.  Default=true.

'Mark thermal entry/exit' : More for debugging than anything else.  If
  'Box around thermals' and this are both selected, then IGCview will mark
  with a little square those log points at which it thinks you entered and
  left the thermal.  If the 'Box around thermals' option is false, this
  option is ignored.

'Mark sector entry' : if 'true', IGCview draws a little box marking the
  log point at which IGCview thinks you entered the TP sector.  Default=true.

'Mark turnpoints on map' : if 'true' draw a little circle on the map for
  every turnpoint found in the TP database.

'Display TP names' : if 'true', write the TP names for every TP in the
  TP database on the map at the correct point.

'Display turnpoint sectors on the map' : TP sectors are always drawn on
  the 'TP Detail" window, but if this option is 'true' then they will
  also be drawn on the main map window.  The 'TP Detail' window seemed
  like a good idea at the time, but the funky zoom and the sectors and
  ruler on the main map probably make the 'TP Detail' window redundant.

'Draw altitude sticks in Replay (default BELOW)': if 'true', IGCview
  draws a vertical stick above or below the glider icon in the maggot
  race, to give an indication of altitude.  If it's false, no altitude
  sticks will be drawn.

'Altitude sticks ABOVE planes'; if 'true', and the above option is 'true',
  the altitude sticks will be drawn ABOVE the planes.  If
  this option if 'false', and the obove option is 'true', then altitude
  sticks will be drawn BELOW the planes in the maggot race.  Note that
  if the altitude sticks are drawn below the plane, then the BOTTOM of
  the stick represents the position of the plane on the map - you have
  to imagine the stick as a pin, with the plane on the top.

'Glider icons in Replay (default LOLLIPOPS)' : if 'true' then little
  glider icons aligned to the track will be drawn in the maggot race.  If
  'false', then lollipops will be drawn which are less fun to look at but
  possibly easier to disinguish in a race of 30+ gliders.

'Trim track logs before start/finish' : if 'true', and you've got a task
  defined, IGCview will only draw a small amount of the log preceding the
  task, to reduce clutter on the map.  If you think there's something
  important in there, then switch this option off and have a look.

'Beer-can TP sectors': if 'true' then IGCview will only use distance to
  check the validity of turns around turnpoints, i.e. the flight must fall
  within the 'radius of TP sector' to be accepted as an ok turn.  If 'false',
  then IGCview uses the IGC photo sectors, 45 degrees either side of the
  bisector of the ingoing and outgoing tracks (these tracks are given in the
  "Define Task" panel accessible off the main window).

'Radius of TP sector (meters)' : see above beer-can stuff.

'Perpendicular start line (vs photo sector)' : if 'true' (the default),
  IGCview will accept as a valid start point the last log point in a 
  180 degree start sector opposite the outgoing first leg (i.e. a usual
  start 'line').  If 'false', IGCview uses an IGC photo sector 45 degrees
  either side of the out-going first leg.

'Radius of start line (km)': IGC will only accept a valid start for a log
  point within this distance from the startpoint (and also within the
  sector as described above).

'Local time offset from UTC': All IGC file data is UTC (Greenwich Mean Time).
  IGCview will add this constant to all times displayed to give you local time.

The following config parameters can be set by XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

'Startup scale (pixels/degree)'
